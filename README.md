## About me 

I started off my programming journey 10 years ago, when I laid eyes on the beautiful monstrosity that is the Unity Engine. 

Now, I work professionally as a Full-Stack Dev. My past experience includes working with Fortune 500 companies such as **PNC**, **McCormick**, and Austin-based startup **Colorfull**.  

My work follows these three mantras:

1) Build Fast (without sacrificing quality)
2) Ship Fast (without sacrificing features)
3) Think Fast (give you all the facts so that you can make the right decisions)

Most of my work lies behind closed doors, but you can view my most recent projects on my [Portfolio](https://www.lococoder.com)

I'm blessed to be doing what I love - coding ‚òïÔ∏è üíª
