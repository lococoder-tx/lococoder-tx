*Recovering Game Developer and Full-Stack Software Engineer*

I like to to kick ass and write code.

But mostly just write code.

## About me 

I started off my programming journey 10 years ago, when I laid eyes on the beautiful monstrosity that is the Unity Engine. Most of my games are still on here (the ones I'm not ashamed of), and one of my most starred repos is a [Diablo Clone](https://github.com/lococoder-tx/Diablo-Clone) that I built in Unity. 

My work follows these three mantras:

1) Build Fast (without sacrificing quality)
2) Ship Fast (without sacrificing features)
3) Think Fast (give you all the facts so that you can make the right decisions)

Most of my work lies behind closed doors, but you can view my past projects and resume on my [Portfolio](https://www.lococoder.com)

I'm lucky - I'm blessed to be doing what I love - coding ‚òïÔ∏è üíª

I'd have it no other way.
